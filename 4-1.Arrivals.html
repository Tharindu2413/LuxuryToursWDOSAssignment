    <ul >
    <li>The small island is proud of eight UNESCO World Heritage sites, which can be visited within one week. These include historic Galle in the south of the Island with its famous fort from the Dutch colonial period. In the heart of Sri Lanka, right in the mountainous jungle, Kandy, the hidden kingdom and the religious capital, awaits to be discovered. The gigantic monolith Sigiriya and the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are also worth seeing – as well as the cave temple of Dambulla, the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Central Highlands.</li>
   <li> Nearly all the world's major religious denominations are represented in Sri Lanka. Add to this a plethora of ethnicities and social groupings, and the result is a crowded festival calendar.</li>
   <li>Numerous colorful festivals, giving new life to ancient traditions and spiritual practices of the islanders, are not to be missed. A highlight for all senses is Aluth Avurudda – the Hindu and Buddhist New Year's festival in April. For two days life takes place on the streets – with music, fireworks and delicious food. The Vesak festival in May is the most important festival of the Buddhists, which marks the first month of the Buddhist calendar year. Roads and houses are decorated with ornate lanterns and all of Sri Lanka looks like a single sea of lights. At the Kandy Festival (July/August) vacationers can immerse themselves into the medieval past of Sri Lanka: ancient costumes, vibrant dances, music and decorated elephants unleash the beauty of the rich tradition of the island.</li>
    <li>Sri Lanka is a haven for nature lovers: from whale watching on the southernmost point Dondra Head to an elephant encounter in the Minneriya National Park or an expedition through the rainforest of Sinharaja – the biodiversity of the island is stunning and 13% of Sri Lanka are conserved as national parks, reserves, sanctuaries and jungle corridors.</li>

   <li> A safari in one of the 14 national parks offers the chance to see some of Sri Lanka's 91 mammals (16 endemic) – elephant, leopard, sloth bear, sambhur, spotted deer, hog, mouse- and barking-deer, wild boar, porcupine, ant-eater, civet cat, loris, giant squirrel, and monkeys such as the macaque, purple-faced leaf monkey and grey langur. The island is also an ornithologist's paradise, with over 233 resident species, (33 endemic) – but migratory species stretch the number to an astounding 482. There are 171 reptiles (101 endemic including two crocodile species).</li>
